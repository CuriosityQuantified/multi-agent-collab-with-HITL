# Multi-Agent Collaboration System with Human-in-the-Loop

A dynamic multi-agent collaboration system that enables structured discussions and decision-making with human oversight. The system features multiple specialized agents working together to solve problems while maintaining clear communication and reaching consensus through a natural discussion process.

## Current Functionality

### 1. Dynamic Agent System
- Support for multiple specialized agents with different roles and expertise
- Configurable agent parameters (temperature, system prompts)
- Natural turn-taking and discussion flow
- Prevention of role-playing and cross-agent impersonation

### 2. Structured Collaboration Process
1. **Discussion Phase**
   - Natural, flowing discussion between agents
   - Building upon previous contributions
   - Sharing expertise and insights
   - Identifying potential issues and improvements
   - Focus on substantive content

2. **Consensus Phase**
   - Thorough analysis before voting
   - Independent decision-making
   - Clear voting mechanism
   - Prevention of premature consensus
   - Required justification for decisions

3. **Final Answer Phase**
   - Structured final answer format
   - Validation of format and completeness
   - Clear section organization
   - Implementation details and considerations
   - Practical examples

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Features
- Regular checkpoints for human feedback
- Ability to guide the discussion
- Override capabilities
- Progress tracking and phase management
- Conversation logging and monitoring

### 4. Quality Control
- Message validation system
- Format enforcement
- Role-playing prevention
- Consensus verification
- Final answer validation

### 5. Technical Features
- Error handling and recovery
- Conversation logging to CSV
- Token counting and management
- Environment variable configuration
- Debug mode support
